### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Emi! I was a Graphic Designer and have a Graphic Design degree, even though my passion has always been creating digital experiences through programming.

I have knowledge in both Backend and Frontend technologies and Iâ€™m currently working as a Frontend Developer. Besides programming my two other passions are playing videogames ðŸŽ® and spending time training my pet cockatiel ðŸ¦œ. 

I work as a Frontend Development Associate Manager at Accenture Song in eCommerce transformation projects. I appreciate being part of a work environment that allows you to grow by learning new technologies while also taking part in huge projects with amazing people. Aside from daily programming tasks, my focus is now in training teams, writing easy to understand documentations, implementing projects and learning new technologies. 

Iâ€™m currently focusing on technologies such as VTEX IO, VTEX Store Framework, JavaScript, ReactJS, GraphQL while I learn NodeJS.

In my free time I also enjoy testing my knowledge by creating projects. One of my open-source projects is [Steamcito ðŸ§‰](https://github.com/emilianog94/Steamcito-Precios-Steam-Argentina-Impuestos-Incluidos), a browser extension which automatically calculates Argentinian taxes on the Steam storefront. It currently has around 200k weekly users on the Chrome Web Store, something which i never imagined!
