## Bio üå±

I was a Graphic Designer and have a Graphic Design degree, even though my passion has always been creating digital experiences through programming.

I work as a Frontend Development Associate Manager at Accenture Song in eCommerce transformation projects. I appreciate being part of a work environment that allows you to grow by learning new technologies while also taking part in huge projects with amazing people. Aside from daily programming tasks, my focus is now in training teams, writing easy to understand documentations, implementing projects and learning new technologies. 

In my free time I also enjoy testing my knowledge by creating projects.

This extension automatically calculates Argentinian taxes and shows the final price on every section of the Steam storefront, among many other features. **It has around 200k weekly users!**
- **[VTEX IO Shortcuts](https://github.com/emilianog94/vtex-io-shortcuts)** : Browser extension i developed while i was working as a Frontend Developer on stores running VTEX Store Framework in order to optimise debugging workflows and getting to know VTEX APIs.
